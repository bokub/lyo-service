## What is this?

These are the remains of an automated bot which was able to run [Lyo](https://github.com/bokub/lyo) on npm modules and publish them as browser-compatible libraries.

You can still see and use the [previously compiled modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~lyo)

## Service shutdown

This service was based on the **ZEIT Now 1.0 platform**, which was shut down **7th of august 2020**.

**Now 2.0** (AKA Vercel) has too many limitations (no file system, duration limits...), making this service impossible to migrate.

Thank you to everyone who enjoyed `lyo.now.sh` üëç
